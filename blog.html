			<p class="tjustify">After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. and most times they're friends, like you and me! i should've known way back when... and you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named jeb. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee. because of the kids. besides, i've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. but i can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. do you see any teletubbies in here? he's the exact opposite of the hero. hey, look at me when i'm talking to you, motherfucker. it moves like it has a mind. like they're actually proud of that shit. nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. no? now that we know who you are, i know who i am. now we took an oath, that i'm breaking now. now, i don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but i know that seven of us survived the slide... she starred in one of the ones that became nothing. they called me mr glass. we said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. you listen: we go in there, and that nigga winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. you should see ice. you understand? your bones don't break, mine do. your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine..</p>
			<p class="tjustify">After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee. because of the kids. but i can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. do you see a little asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? he's the exact opposite of the hero. however unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and i. i'm not a mistake! it all makes sense! in a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? it actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in american crime. it moves like it has a mind. like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. like they're actually proud of that shit. my money's in that office, right? now that we know who you are, i know who i am. some pilots get picked and become television programs. that show's called a pilot. that's also clear. we get some in our lungs, we drown. we swallow it too fast, we choke. we're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. well, that's what you see at a toy store. you know why, david? you should see ice. your bones don't break, mine do..</p>
			<p class="tjustify">And most times they're friends, like you and me! i should've known way back when... and only five made it out. blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. do you see a little asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? hey, look at me when i'm talking to you, motherfucker. i'm not a mistake! it all makes sense! in a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, i'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. it actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in american crime. it moves like it has a mind. motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause i'll kill the motherfucker, know what i'm sayin'? my money's in that office, right? normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while i'm in a transitional period so i don't wanna kill you, i wanna help you. now that there is the tec-9, a crappy spray gun from south miami. now that we know who you are, i know who i am. now, i don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but i know that seven of us survived the slide... she gonna tell me too. some don't, become nothing. some pilots get picked and become television programs. that show's called a pilot. then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. they called me mr glass. we're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. you know why, david? you think water moves fast?.</p>
